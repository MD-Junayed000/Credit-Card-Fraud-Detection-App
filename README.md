# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only ~0.172% of transactions marked as fraud.

---

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Total Transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraudulent Transactions**: 492 (‚âà 0.172%)
- **Normal Transactions**: 284,315
- **Duration Covered**: 2 days
- **Features**: 
  - `Time` and `Amount` (raw features)
  - `V1` to `V28`: anonymized features from PCA transformation
  - `Class`: Target variable (`0` = Not Fraud, `1` = Fraud)

---

##  Objective

Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques, despite the class imbalance. Evaluate models using suitable metrics like AUPRC, Recall, F1 Score, and visualize model performance.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Duplicates**: 1081 rows were exact duplicates and dropped.
- **Fraud Timing**:
  - Peaks around hour 10‚Äì12, 26, and 42 out of 48 hours.
- **Fraud Amount**:
  - Fraudulent transactions are usually low-to-mid in amount.
- **Correlation Matrix**:
  - Features like `V4`, `V11`, `V2`, `V17`, `V14` showed strongest correlation (¬±0.1‚Äì0.3) with the fraud class.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

- Dropped duplicates
- Scaled `Time` and `Amount` using `StandardScaler`
- Created undersampled and SMOTE-balanced datasets
- Selected top features based on correlation and model importance

---

## üîÅModels Implemented

### ‚úÖ Random Forest (Undersampling)

- Balanced classes by undersampling majority (non-fraud) class
- Achieved **AUPRC ~0.98**, **ROC-AUC ~0.98**, **F1 ~0.96**

### ‚úÖ XGBoost with SMOTE

- Used pipeline: `SMOTE + XGBoost`
- Tuned hyperparameters using `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Achieved high F1, Precision, Recall and AUPRC

### ‚úÖ LightGBM and Logistic Regression (for comparison)

- Logistic Regression was used with class weighting
- LightGBM used for speed and scalability

##  Evaluation Metrics

Due to imbalance, we prioritized:

| Metric         | Why It Matters                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **AUPRC**      | Best for imbalanced data               |
| **F1 Score**   | Balances precision & recall            |
| **Recall**     | Catch as many frauds as possible       |
| **Precision**  | Avoid false alarms                     |
| **ROC-AUC**    | Measures separability (used secondarily) |

## üìâ Visualizations

- **Precision-Recall Curve**
- **ROC Curve**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Correlation Heatmaps**
- **Transaction Time Distribution**

##  **Deploy Locally** (Can be more understood from the streamlit-deply Branch)
  - Use `joblib` to load model
  - Run with `streamlit run app.py`
